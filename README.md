Algorithms in Python 3.10 for Burden and Faires - Numerical Analysis 10e

Adapted from the code written in C by Richard L. Burden/Annette M. Burden.
Please see book website for code: https://sites.google.com/site/numericalanalysis1burden/module-7/c

Makes use of Numpy for some algorithms but I have tried to use only the Math module where possible.
