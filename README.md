Algorithms in Python for Burden and Faires - Numerical Analysis 10e

Adapted from the code written in C 10 by Richard L. Burden/Annette M. Burden.
Please see book website for code: https://sites.google.com/site/numericalanalysis1burden/module-7/c

I have tested code with various examples from the textbook and mostly seem to reproduce the correct results.

Still need to add file input/output. The structure of the code is also very much derived from the C programs mentioned above,
and may not be very "Pythonic".
