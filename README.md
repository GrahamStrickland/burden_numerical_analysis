Algorithms in Python for Burden and Faires - Numerical Analysis 10e

Adapted from the code written in C by Richard L. Burden/Annette M. Burden.
Please see book website for code: https://sites.google.com/site/numericalanalysis1burden/module-7/c

I have tested code with various examples from the textbook and mostly seem to reproduce the correct results.

One major difference from the textbook code is that I still need to add file input/output. For now,
all output is to the console in the form of tables where appropriate.

The structure of the code is also very much derived from the C programs mentioned above,
and may not be very "Pythonic".

Makes use of Numpy for some algorithms but I have tried to use only the Math module where possible.
